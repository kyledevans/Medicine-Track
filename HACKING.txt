Coding style guidelines:

1.  Use tabs for indentation not spaces.

When putting includes do it as follows for all *.h files:
#include <SYSTEM_INCLUDES>

#include "local_includes"

#ifndef FILE_H
#define FILE_H
#include <parant_class_include_only>
#endif


For all *.cpp files.  Note the location of QDebug include:
#include "class_file"
#include "ui_class_file"

#include <SYSTEM_INCLUDES>

#include "local_includes"

#include <QDebug>


UI Strings.  I'm using the Qt Translating infrastructure to keep similar strings consistent when used in several places throughout the application.

In order to use the tools effectively, here are some rules.  Strings that are meant to be "translated" will be in ALL CAPS.

Always add a disambiguation for QLabels and tooltips.  The format for the disambiguation will be:
	- All caps
	- Use the form: <data> <EDIT, DISPLAY, SEARCH> <LABEL, TOOLTIP>

An example would be a widget that appears like so: "Medication: Amoxicillin" where "Medication" is a
QLabel followed by a QLabel that has the medication name inserted by C++.  The disambiguation would
read as such:
	MEDICATION DISPLAY LABEL
Now the tooltip for the "Medication" QLabel would be as such:
	MEDICATION DISPLAY TOOLTIP


For every column in the database there should be a string for every EDIT, DISPLAY, SEARCH and corresponding LABEL and TOOLTIP versions.

Deployment (windows)

Prerequisites:
	1. WiX
	2. dotNetInstaller
	3. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable (SP1)
	4. Unzip "code_39_logitogo.zip".  Place "Code-39-Logitogo.ttf" in the top level directory of the Medicine Track source.
	6. Assumes that Qt is installed in C:\Qt.  If this is not the case, then either: move it there for this step(easiest) or edit all references to the Qt dir in mtrack_win32.wxs

Instructions:
	1. Download the MSVC 2010 Redistributable (SP1) (vcredist_x86.exe)
	2. Font prep:
		- Unzip "code_39_logitogo.zip"
		- Place "Code-39-Logitogo.ttf" in the top level directory of the Medicine Track source.
		- Rename "manual_and_license_V1.2.pdf" to "code_39_license.pdf" and place it in the top level directory of the Medicine Track source.
	3. Run the batch file "make_win_installers.bat"
	4. With dotNetInstaller (run InstallerEditor) you will need to edit 2 things.  Start by going to File -> Open -> "dotnet_config.xml".
		- Navigate to Config File -> install: -> vcredist_x86.exe.  Edit the "sourcefilepath" so that it points to the location of the vcredist_x86.exe that you downloaded.
		- Navigate to Config File -> install: -> mtrack_win32.msi.  Edit the "sourcefilepath" so that it points to the location of the mtrack_win32.msi that you created.
	5. Click on File -> Create Exe
	6. For Template dotNetInstaller.exe File, use one of the exe's included with dotNetInstaller.  Specifically "dotNetInstaller.exe" located in <dotNetInstaller-path>\bin\dotNetInstaller.exe
	7. Click Make
