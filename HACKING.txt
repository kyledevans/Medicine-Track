Coding style guidelines:

1.  Use tabs for indentation not spaces.

When putting includes do it as follows for all *.h files:
#include <SYSTEM_INCLUDES>

#include "local_includes"

#ifndef FILE_H
#define FILE_H
#include <parant_class_include_only>
#endif


For all *.cpp files.  Note the location of QDebug include:
#include "class_file"
#include "ui_class_file"

#include <SYSTEM_INCLUDES>

#include "local_includes"

#include <QDebug>


UI Strings.  I'm using the Qt Translating infrastructure to keep similar strings consistent when used in several places throughout the application.

In order to use the tools effectively, here are some rules.  Strings that are meant to be "translated" will be in ALL CAPS.

Always add a disambiguation for QLabels and tooltips.  The format for the disambiguation will be:
	- All caps
	- Use the form: <data> <EDIT, DISPLAY, SEARCH> <LABEL, TOOLTIP>

An example would be a widget that appears like so: "Medication: Amoxicillin" where "Medication" is a
QLabel followed by a QLabel that has the medication name inserted by C++.  The disambiguation would
read as such:
	MEDICATION DISPLAY LABEL
Now the tooltip for the "Medication" QLabel would be as such:
	MEDICATION DISPLAY TOOLTIP


For every column in the database there should be a string for every EDIT, DISPLAY, SEARCH and corresponding LABEL and TOOLTIP versions.
