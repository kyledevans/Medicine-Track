2.  Possible feature is to be able to combine patients into 1.  IE: the clerk fails to find the existing patient record when filling a prescription and instead creates a duplicate patient record.

4.  Need to be able to print new barcodes after a shipment has been registered in the database.  IE: The barcodes are destroyed somehow.

7.  Every time the user does something that changes information on the database, post a message to the status bar at the bottom.

8.  The application needs to always indicate whether or not it is connected to the database.

12.  Combine the prescribers and pharmacists tables into 1

13.  Need to add some usage documentation and help.
	- Adding/modifying a patient
	- Adding a prescription
	- Adding new/modifying formulary
	- Adding new/modifying inventory
	- Search for patients
	- Search for prescriptions
	- Search formulations
	- Search inventory
	- Search pharmacists
	- Search prescribers

14.  Remove the "active" checkbox from all wizards.  Should only be able to active/reactive by right clicking them on a resultTable.
	- Also need to add the ability to search for inactive records

15.  Remove the ability to modify anything (possible exception being patients)
	- It will make the prescription log be inacurate if say the name of a medication is changed after the prescription has been given.

Questions:

Q1.  Figure out how NDC's should be handled.
	A1.  Make a large enough char field and store them.  NDC's can be of several forms so allow for that and don't rely on them to be meaningful.

Q2.  Is some information not allowed to be changed after creation?  IE: how many units were in a shipment.
	A2.  

Q3.  Are labels that will be printed all the same physical size?
	A3.  Yes for now.

Q4.  Do liquid medications that share the same NDC come in identical same strengths and sizes?
	A4. Elixers and suspensions do
