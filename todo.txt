2.  Possible feature is to be able to combine patients into 1.  IE: the clerk fails to find the existing patient record when filling a prescription and instead creates a duplicate patient record.

4.  Need to be able to print new barcodes after a shipment has been registered in the database.  IE: The barcodes are destroyed somehow.

5.  It would be nice if when in the inventory screen, the user could print a report detailing who received a prescription by lot number.  IE: There is a recall on the drug and we need to start making calls to patients.

7.  Every time the user does something that changes information on the database, post a message to the status bar at the bottom.

8.  The application needs to always indicate whether or not it is connected to the database.

9.  Figure out how the database will handle users being idle for a long time.

12.  Combine the prescribers and pharmacists tables into 1

13.  See if converting the resultTables into QTableWidgets helps when trying to detect if a user has made a selection.

Questions:

Q1.  Figure out how NDC's should be handled.
	A1.  Make a large enough char field and store them.  NDC's can be of several forms so allow for that and don't rely on them to be meaningful.

Q2.  Is some information not allowed to be changed after creation?  IE: how many units were in a shipment.
	A2.  

Q3.  Are labels that will be printed all the same physical size?
	A3.  Yes for now.

Q4.  Do liquid medications that share the same NDC come in identical same strengths and sizes?
	A4. Elixers and suspensions do
