2.  Possible feature is to be able to combine patients into 1.  IE: the clerk fails to find the existing patient record when filling a prescription and instead creates a duplicate patient record.

3.  Maybe make the drug form to be an enum type.  IE: Tablet, Capsule, etc.

4.  Need to be able to print new barcodes after a shipment has been registered in the database.  IE: The barcodes are destroyed somehow.

5.  It would be nice if when in the inventory screen, the user could print a report detailing who received a prescription by lot number.  IE: There is a recall on the drug and we need to start making calls to patients.

7.  Every time the user does something that changes information on the database, post a message to the status bar at the bottom.

8.  The application needs to always indicate whether or not it is connected to the database.

10.  Make some kind of error reporting feature.  Nothing too fancy at first.

11.  Combine the prescribers and pharmacists tab into 1

12.  Combine the prescribers and pharmacists tables into 1

	A4. Elixers and suspensions do
